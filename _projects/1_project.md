    Weyl semimetal non-equilibrium setting with distinct chemical potentials
</div>

We studied the non-linear transport signatures of electrochemical forces on the prototypical Weyl semimetal as well as nodal line semimetals. The first has a quantized response when the chemical potential is distinct for each Weyl node, while the last one has a parity anomaly response that wee verify survives for finite temperatures.
