We unravel distinct topological phenomena present in time reversal invariant matter. We show that ultra-thin realizations of topological insulators display properties of both the lower dimensional topological phase and response signatures of the higher dimensional phase. We also introduce a pseudo-spin analogue of Skyrmion phases valid when time reversal symmetry is present, we link the topoological invariant to reduced density matrices of the pseudo spin subsystem with disorder robust edge states and gapless reduced entanglement spectrum.
