	abstract = {In this paper we study the soliton dynamics of a high-density Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to a time-oscillating trap. The behavior of the BEC is described with a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation (mGPE) which takes into account three-body losses, atomic feeding and quantum fluctuations (up to a novel high-density term). A variational approximation (VA) is used to study the behavior of a Gaussian pulse in a static double-well potential. Direct numerical solutions of the mGPE corroborate that the center of the pulse exhibits an oscillatory behavior (as the VA predicts), and show a novel phenomenon of fragmentation and regeneration (FR). It is shown that this FR process is destroyed if we consider a potential with a time-dependent quadratic term, but the FR survives if the time dependence is introduced in a cubic term. Comparison between the VA and the numerical solution revealed an excellent agreement when the oscillations of the pulse remain in one of the potential wells. The effects of the quantum fluctuating terms on the FR process are studied. Finally, variational results using a supergaussian trial function are obtained.},

	abstract = {Nodal-line semimetals are topological phases where the conduction and the valence bands cross each other along one-dimensional lines in the Brillouin zone, which are symmetry protected by either spatial symmetries or time-reversal symmetry. In particular, nodal lines protected by the combined symmetry exhibits the parity anomaly of 2D Dirac fermions. In this letter, we study the electrochemical transport in Dirac nodal-line semimetals by using the semiclassical Boltzmann equation approach. We derive a general formula for the topological current that includes both the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We first evaluate the electrochemical current by introducing a small mass term (which could be induced by inversion-breaking uniaxial strain, pressure, or an external electric field) and apply it to the hexagonal pnictide CaAgP. The electrochemical current vanishes in the zero-mass limit. Introducing a tilting term that does not spoil symmetry that protects the nodal ring, we obtain a finite electrochemical current in the zero-mass limit, which can be regarded as a direct consequence of the parity anomaly. We show that the parity-anomaly–induced electrochemical transport is also present at nonzero temperatures.},
